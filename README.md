🧱 Suggested Python-Based Tech Stack
🔙 Backend: Python
✅ Framework

    FastAPI
    ➤ Fast, modern, async-ready, perfect for building high-performance APIs.
    ➤ Automatically generates Swagger UI docs.

🗃️ Database

  - PostgreSQL (relational, perfect for calendar/event data)

  - ORM: SQLModel (from FastAPI's creator, combines SQLAlchemy + Pydantic)

    -OR use Tortoise ORM (if you want async support)

    -OR SQLAlchemy (standard and flexible)

🗂️ API Structure

    /events — Create, read, update, delete events

    /notes — Create/read/update/delete notes

    /calendar — Fetch calendar views (by day, week, month)

🔐 Authentication (Optional)

    OAuth2 + JWT using FastAPI’s built-in tools

    OR plug in Authlib for social login (Google, GitHub)

🌐 Frontend Options

If you want to stay Pythonic:

    Streamlit or Anvil: For rapid UI development (but not as customizable as React)

If you're okay with using JS for the frontend:

    React.js or Svelte + Tailwind CSS
    ➤ These pair well with FastAPI and give you full control.

🗄️ Alternative Full-Stack Option

If you prefer a one-stop shop:
🌟 Django + Django REST Framework

    Full-stack Python web framework

    Comes with built-in admin panel, auth, and ORM

    Use Django REST Framework to expose APIs

    Calendar UI can be built with Django Templates, or you can add React for the frontend
