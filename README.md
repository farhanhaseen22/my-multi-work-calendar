# my-multi-work-calendar
Stupid name I know but that's the working title for now.

This is meant to be a Calendar App that will adapt to the different sort of work schedules I or anyone may have in their lives.

# Progress

- [x] Started an React app using CRA.
- [x] Getting the first Calendar page started. Good homepage.
- [ ] Adding various features.
- [ ] Will try to create an React app using Vite.
- [ ] Making events and pointing it on Calendar.

üîô Backend: Python.

‚úÖ Framework: FastAPI.

    FastAPI:

    ‚û§ Fast, modern, async-ready, perfect for building high-performance APIs.
    ‚û§ Automatically generates Swagger UI docs.

üóÉÔ∏è Database

- PostgreSQL (relational, perfect for calendar/event data)

- ORM: SQLModel (from FastAPI's creator, combines SQLAlchemy + Pydantic)

- OR use Tortoise ORM (if you want async support)

- OR SQLAlchemy (standard and flexible)

üóÇÔ∏è API Structure

    /events ‚Äî Create, read, update, delete events

    /notes ‚Äî Create/read/update/delete notes

    /calendar ‚Äî Fetch calendar views (by day, week, month)

üîê Authentication (Optional)

    OAuth2 + JWT using FastAPI‚Äôs built-in tools

    OR plug in Authlib for social login (Google, GitHub)

üåê Frontend Options

If you want to stay Pythonic:

    Streamlit or Anvil: For rapid UI development (but not as customizable as React)

If you're okay with using JS for the frontend:
```text
    React.js or Svelte + Tailwind CSS
    ‚û§ These pair well with FastAPI and give you full control.
```
